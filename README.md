# my-newdotfiles

trying to use standard .dotfiles between all systems

## Goals
* Any *nix like system has the same basic personalized settings
* Software
* Symlinked files
* a script/process that copies the dotfile repo down, installs any needed software, and setups up the links
    * How will this work?
* things to be included.  neovim, vim, ff, 
* Need more

## Fixes

* Got my pluggins to load again.
* Turned Cursor line hl off, or really need to learn how to change it's color so its more
  readable.
